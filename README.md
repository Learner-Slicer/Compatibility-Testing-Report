Task 2 – Compatibility Testing Report

Web Page Tested:
[https://shoplane-by-lassie.netlify.app](https://shoplane-by-lassie.netlify.app)

Devices and Browsers Used:
- Windows Laptop – Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge
- Android Phone – Chrome Mobile

Observations:

Chrome (Windows Laptop):
- Layout looks normal across all sections.
- Buttons are responsive and functional.
- No major issues found while browsing or navigating.

Firefox (Windows Laptop):
- All links and buttons work properly.
- Product images take slightly longer to load compared to Chrome.
- No layout break or styling issues noticed.

Microsoft Edge (Windows Laptop):
- Worked smoothly.
- Navigation, buttons, and product cards display correctly.
- Nothing seemed broken.

Chrome (Android Phone):
- Navbar covers part of the page when scrolling.
- Product images load slower than desktop.
- “Add to Cart” works but button animation is very basic.
- Layout is a little squeezed on smaller screens.

Suggested Fixes:
- Fix mobile navbar so it doesn't overlap page content while scrolling.
- Improve loading speed of images for mobile users.
- Add better feedback when buttons are pressed (like animations or color changes).

Conclusion:
The website worked fine on desktop browsers and was mostly smooth. On mobile, some layout and loading issues were noticed, especially with the navbar and image speed. A few small changes can improve mobile compatibility and user experience.
